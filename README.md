# sych

## Introduction

Sych short for `psych` is to understand the `psyche` of the developers who has worked on a specific part of the code. They can do a memory dump of feature they are developing by creating a markdown file anywhere inside the project. It just looks for all markdown files inside your project folder and creates a very nice docs. It creates a single static `.html` which can be shared or looked at by other people.

Running sych is quite simple, you just put the `sych` binary from release to your PATH and run

```sh
sych
```

### Goal

The goal of sych is to save developer's time by keeping the documentation inside the project itself and to provide a `**[powerful and extensible]**` document generation engine.
